Protocol Used : 
1. All he new nWorker processes are created in newMatrixMul()
2. There are 2 pipes used ==> fd1[] & fd2[].
3. For every worker process, write-end is closed in fd1[] and read-end is closed in fd2[];
4. Parent has read-end closed in fd1[] & write-end closed in fd2[].
5. Parent process reads the data from a[n1][n2] & b[n2][n3] and sends to worker process
6. Each worker process performs the calculation and returns the product to parent
7. Parent receives the product and writes to c[i][j].

======================================================================================

Sometimes while running the 6x6 size matrix, there occurs unwanted messages which are
errorsome logs. However it generates the proper output.

There are no broker pipe cases in my program.
