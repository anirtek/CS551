On a particular C system a <tt>short</tt> occupies 2 bytes with an

      which is divisible by 2.  Discuss how you would proceed to
      tighten this alignment restriction to force a particular <tt>short</tt>
      entity to always be stored at an address divisible by 8.
      Document any assumptions in your solution. <i>5-points</i>

Given an instance of class <tt>C</tt> in a classical OOPL, instances of
      classes totally unrelated to <tt>C</tt> can have <tt>public</tt> access to the
      instance variables of <tt>C</tt>.  The techniques discussed in class
      for simulating OOP in C in the oo-shapes example and <a href="../../projects/prj1/prj1.html">prj1</a> do not allow such access,
      limiting access to the instance variables of C solely to the
      instances of C.  How would you modify the techniques to allow
      access similar to <tt>public</tt>?  <i>10-points</i>
</p>
<p><li>
How would you extend the techniques discussed in class for
      simulating OOP in C in the oo-shapes example and <a href="../../projects/prj1/prj1.html">prj1</a> to allow for interfaces.
      Specifically, how would you make it possible for a client to
      take a <tt>Shape</tt> and treat is as a <tt>DrawableInterface</tt> where
      <tt>DrawableInterface</tt> will reference the following functions:
<pre>
      typedef struct {
        void (*draw)(DrawableInterface *drawable, GraphicsContext *ctx);
      } DrawableFns;
</pre>
<p>
      for some graphics context <tt>ctx</tt>.
</p>
<p>
      For example, there may be a inheritance hierarchy like
      <tt>WireFrame</tt> different from the <tt>Shape</tt> hierarchy which may also
      implement a <tt>Drawable</tt> interface.
</p>
<p>
      Like the rest of the techniques, using a <tt>Shape</tt> as a
      <tt>DrawableInterface</tt> may require that the client follow certain
      rules and need not be as seamless as in a real OOPL. <i>10-points</i>
</p>
</p>
<p><li>
Real OOPL's protect objects from invalid access.  For example,
      given the Java <tt>class</tt>:
<pre>
      class Circle extends Shape {
        private final double radius;

        Circle(double r) { radius = r; }

        double getRadius() { return radius; }
      }
</pre>
<p>
      [For those unfamiliar with Java, the above declares <tt>Circle</tt>
      to be a subclass of <tt>Shape</tt> with all <tt>Circle</tt> instances
      having a single field <tt>radius</tt> which cannot be changed
      (<tt>final</tt>) once the instance has been constructed (using
      the <tt>Circle()</tt> constructor)].
</p>
<p>
      With normal Java semantics, is impossible for a client of
      <tt>Circle</tt> to change the radius of a <tt>Circle</tt> instance once it has
      been constructed (ignoring reflection which makes a mockery of
      things like <tt>final</tt> declarations).
</p>
<p>
      Since C is not a OOPL, it makes no such guarantees.  Show how a
      client of <tt>Circle</tt> (implemented as in the <tt>oo-shapes</tt> example
      discussed in class) could modify the radius of a <tt>Circle</tt>
      instance after constructing it.  Specifically, you should be
      able to show how you would achieve something like this:
</p>
<pre>
         const Circle *circle1 = newCircle(1);  //radius is 1
         //your code here (cannot change circle1 pointer)
         printf("created circle1 = circle(radius = %g)\n",
                circle1-&gt;fns-&gt;radius(circle1));
</pre>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
     and have it print <tt>created circle1 = circle(radius = 2)</tt>.
</p>
<p>
     You may assume that the client has <b>read-only</b> access to all the
     source code implementing <tt>Shape</tt>'s, <tt>Circle</tt>'s, etc. <i>10-points</i>

<p><li>
Some languages permit <i>lazy evaluation</i>.  How would
      you implement a restricted form of lazy evaluation in C.  A
      motivating example follows:
<p>
      Consider an array of function pointers used as shown below:
</p>
<pre>
        int (*fns[])(int exp) = { ... };

         int p = ...;
         int s = 0;
         for (int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(fns)/sizeof(fns[0]); i++) {
           int (*f)(int) = fns[i];
           int exp = ...; //compute exp(p) for some param p.
           s += f(exp);
         }
</pre>
<p>
      Unfortunately, under some situations, the computation for <tt>exp</tt>
      blows up (maybe a division by zero or referencing a <tt>NULL</tt>
      pointer).  It turns out that the knowledge needed to implement a
      check to see if <tt>exp(p)</tt> is dangerous is not available at the
      level of the above code but is available within each individual
      function.  But since <tt>exp</tt> is evaluated before the call to the
      function, using the check within the function would be too late.
      This could be avoided by using lazy evaluation of <tt>exp</tt>.
</p>
<p>
      How would you set things up so as to delay the evaluation of
      <tt>exp(p)</tt> until after an individual function has been able
      to run the check to ensure that it is safe.  You may change
      both the above code as well as the interface and implementation
      of the individual functions in the array.  <i>10-points</i>

Discuss the validity of the following statements: <i>15-points</i>
<ol type="a">

If a C function is declared with prototype <tt>void f()</tt>
           but then defined with prototype <tt>void f(int a)</tt>, then
           the compiler will signal an error about the inconsistency
           in the prototypes.
</p>
<p><li>
The <tt>stderr</tt> stream need not always be unbuffered.
</p>
<p><li>
It is fine to <tt>malloc()</tt> a single character at a time.
</p>
<p><li>
<tt>NULL</tt> and <tt>0</tt> are equivalent in pointer contexts.
</p>
<p><li>
In the standard I/O library on Unix systems, there is no
           noticeable difference between opening a file as binary versus
           opening it as text.
