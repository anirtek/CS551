You have built a library based on your solution to prj2
     (../../projects/prj2/prj2.html&gt;) and your library has many users
     who access your library implementation using the interface
     defined in <tt>matrix_mul</tt><a href="../../projects/prj2/files/matrix_mul.h">.h</a>.  Your users are happy
     with your library except for its error reporting; they find that
     the single <tt>int</tt> code returned via the <tt>err</tt> pointer does not
     provide sufficient information.  They would like to get back a
     string error message which provides a detailed
     <b>context-sensitive</b> explanation for the error.
<p>
     You have also fixed a bug in your library.  You create a new
     version of your library which contains the bug fix and also
     provides access to string error messages.  What changes would you
     make to the library interface and implementation to meet the
     following constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
Users who are not interested in string errors but are
          interested in your bug fix should be able get access to your
          bug fix by simply relinking their client code with the new
          version of your library <b>without needing to change their
          source code</b>.
</p>
<p><li>
Users who are interested in string errors will make changes
          to their source code and relink with the new version of your
          library.
</p>
<p><li>
Some users have client code which have multiple <tt>MatrixMul</tt>
          objects live at the same time.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
     This question deals only with the interface changes you need to
     make to satisfy the above constraints.  It does not deal with
     the implementation of multiple worker processes, pipes, etc.

A parent process creates <tt>N</tt> <b>interchangeable</b> resources which
      are to be shared among the parent and its descendent processes.
      A resource is referenced by its index <tt>0, ..., (N-1)</tt>.  When a
      process needs a resource, it needs <b>exclusive</b> access to the
      resource.  How would you design a resource manager for these <tt>N</tt>
      resources using pipes as your only IPC mechanism.  You may
      assume that <tt>N</tt> is small (around 4).  Clearly document any other
      assumptions in your design.  <i>10-points</i>

Assuming that function and data pointers have the same
      representation, what would you expect the following function to
      return on a typical Unix system.
<pre>
      char c;

      int f() {
        void *fP = &amp;f;
        void *cP = &amp;c;
        return ((cP &lt; (void *)&amp;cP)&lt;&lt;1) + (fP &lt; (void *)&amp;fP);
      }

Multiple processes need to send messages to a single
      process via a single shared pipe.  It is possible that the size
      of a single message exceeds <tt>PIPE_BUF</tt> bytes.  Design a protocol
      to be followed by the reading process and writing processes so
      that messages can be sent correctly even though the writing
      processes may be writing concurrently to the pipe. <i>10-points</i>

<p><li>
When you inherit a legacy application which does user
      authentication using passwords, you are horrified to find that
      user passwords are hashed using the insecure MD5 algorithm and
      stored in a relational database. You explain the seriousness of
      the problem to your manager.  You suggest a fix which requires
      each user to change their password so that their new password
      can be hashed using a secure Blowfish hash.  Your manager
      rejects your fix as it is too obtrusive for users; in fact, she
      says that she will reject any solution which involves user
      involvement.
<p>
      Describe how you would change the application so that all user
      passwords are protected using Blowfish without requiring users
      to change their passwords. Note that you cannot get access to
      the users' plaintext passwords.  <i>10-points</i>

Assume that a process with real, effective and saved set-user ID
      1000 performs the following sequence of steps:
<ol type="a">
<p><li>
Successfully <tt>exec</tt>'s a non-setuid program.

<p><li>
Successfully <tt>exec</tt>'s a setuid program owned by UID 2000.

<p><li>
Calls <tt>setuid(2000)</tt>.

How would you set up <tt>N</tt> processes with a ring communication structure
      with all IPC handled using anonymous pipes.  Specifically, if the
      processes are <tt>P[0]</tt>, <tt>P[1]</tt>, <tt>P[N - 1]</tt>, then <tt>P[i]</tt> should be able
      to send data to <tt>P[(i + 1)%N]</tt>.  Your answer should detail exactly
      how you would create pipes (including closing of unneeded pipe ends).
      You can make your answer concrete by detailing the exact steps
      needed for <tt>N == 4</tt>. <i>10-points</i>

The text explains that all the other <tt>exec()</tt> functions are
      <i>layered on top of </i><tt>execve()</tt> (pg. 567); i.e. all the other
      <tt>exec()</tt> functions are implemented using it as a primitive.  Of
      the 6 <tt>exec()</tt> functions, is <tt>execve()</tt> the only choice as a
      primitive or could another <tt>exec()</tt> function be chosen as a
      primitive for implementing the rest? <i>10-points</i>

Discuss the validity of the following statements: <i>10-points</i>
<ol type="a">
<p><li>
It is a good idea to close pipe file descriptors when they
           are no longer needed since a process is limited to a certain
           maximum number of open file descriptors.
</p>
<p><li>
If a user with a particular user id creates a file and
           the permissions/ownership on that file are never changed,
           then that user can also remove the file.
</p>
<p><li>
The user and group ownership of a new file is always set to
           the effective uid and gid of the process which created it.
</p>
<p><li>
If a process has execute access to a directory, then it can
           search that directory.
</p>
<p><li>
Once a process <tt>exec</tt>'s a setuid program it will always run
           with an effective uid equal to that of the owner of the
           program.
